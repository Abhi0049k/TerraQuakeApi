## Overview

TerraQuake is a comprehensive seismic data platform that combines a powerful REST API with an intuitive web interface. It provides researchers, developers, and organizations with easy access to real-time earthquake data, advanced filtering capabilities, and interactive visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

- **Backend (TerraQuake API)** ‚Äî Node.js + Express REST API to serve earthquake data.
- **Frontend** ‚Äî React + TailwindCSS interface for visualizing seismic events.
- **Data Source** ‚Äî INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) and synthetic demo data.
- **API Access** ‚Äî Public endpoints for querying earthquakes by time, magnitude, location, and more.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB** (planned for persistent data)
- **JWT** (for secure access, future feature)
- **Custom earthquake generator** (for demo/testing)

### Frontend

- **React 19**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **React Router**
- **Hero sections, maps, charts** (via Leaflet, Chart.js ‚Äì if added)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nagcas/TerraQuakeApi.git
   cd TerraQuakeApi
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `backend/.env-example` to `backend/.env` and fill in required values (e.g., database URL, API keys).
   - Copy `frontend/.env-example` to `frontend/.env` if needed.

5. Run the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Run the frontend (in a new terminal):
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend interface and `http://localhost:5000` for the API endpoints.

Fetches earthquakes from the last 7 days.
- Query: `?limit=50` (optional)

#### `GET /v1/earthquakes/month`
Fetches earthquakes for a specific month and year.
- Query: `?year=2025&month=03&limit=50` (year and month required)

#### `GET /v1/earthquakes/location`
Fetches earthquakes near a latitude/longitude.
- Query: `?latitude=40.835&longitude=14.117&radius=50&limit=50` (lat/lon required)

#### `GET /v1/earthquakes/region`
Fetches earthquakes in a specific Italian region.
- Query: `?region=Campania&limit=50` (region required)

#### `GET /v1/earthquakes/depth`
