# TerraQuake

**TerraQuake** is a full-stack web application designed to monitor and explore global seismic activity. It offers real-time earthquake data, visualizations, and developer-friendly API access. Built by combining geoscience expertise and modern web development, TerraQuake aims to make seismic data more accessible to researchers, developers, and the general public.

---

## Project Overview

- **Backend (TerraQuake API)** ‚Äî Node.js + Express REST API to serve earthquake data.
- **Frontend** ‚Äî React + TailwindCSS interface for visualizing seismic events.
- **Data Source** ‚Äî INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) and synthetic demo data.
- **API Access** ‚Äî Public endpoints for querying earthquakes by time, magnitude, location, and more.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB** (planned for persistent data)
- **JWT** (for secure access, future feature)
- **Custom earthquake generator** (for demo/testing)

### Frontend

- **React 19**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **React Router**
- **Hero sections, maps, charts** (via Leaflet, Chart.js ‚Äì if added)
