## Overview

TerraQuake is a comprehensive seismic data platform that combines a powerful REST API with an intuitive web interface. It provides researchers, developers, and organizations with easy access to real-time earthquake data, advanced filtering capabilities, and interactive visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

- **Backend (TerraQuake API)** ‚Äî Node.js + Express REST API to serve earthquake data.
- **Frontend** ‚Äî React + TailwindCSS interface for visualizing seismic events.
- **Data Source** ‚Äî INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) and synthetic demo data.
- **API Access** ‚Äî Public endpoints for querying earthquakes by time, magnitude, location, and more.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB** (planned for persistent data)
- **JWT** (for secure access, future feature)
- **Custom earthquake generator** (for demo/testing)

### Frontend

- **React 19**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **React Router**
- **Hero sections, maps, charts** (via Leaflet, Chart.js ‚Äì if added)
